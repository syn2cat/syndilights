This is the Proof of Concept code for the 4x5 Windows mock-up.
With a 4-7Segment Display

It is a static mockup that should be used to make a Video and show off the theory of the project.

The shift Array code is from this Tutorial page:

General information about shift registers: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shift_register

The one used for driving the 7 segment LED is a standard (SN)74HC595 which is an 8bit Shift register.
Datasheet: http://www.nxp.com/documents/data_sheet/74HC_HCT595.pdf

The used module is a 16 segment element with one decimal dot (http://www.adafruit.com/datasheets/BL-S80A-13.PDF)
UHR (Ultra High Red) version

We used a single in-line i(SIL) resistor to make our lives easy. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resistor
