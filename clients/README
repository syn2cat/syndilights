The goal is to make a nice python client library that allows us to quickly make new clients.

First goal is to get cellular.py and plasma.py to work through full stack.

plasma.py sends packets to:
frameserver, which sends packets to:
ws_udp.js, which sends it to the visionneuse.html client.

PROBLEMS:
- For some reason the cellular.py packet is not being processed by the frameserver
- When running plasma.py there is an alignment error in visionneuse.hml
