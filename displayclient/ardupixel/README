This recieves a syn2lighs packet via UDP and displays it on an neopixel array
The arduino does the conversion from normal x/y coordinates to physical pixels.
This means thet the physical layout should not be of concern for the
sender of the UDP packet. Top left is always 0,0

The neopixel array can be set up several ways:

Feed in is in one of the 4 corners
From there it goes vertically in zigzag to the opposing side.
e.g. feed in is top left corner
Left down, then 1 right, up gain, 1 right etc...

Alternatively it can also go horizontally in zigzag to the opposite side

Enhancement: have dip switches to configure max X/Y and layout
