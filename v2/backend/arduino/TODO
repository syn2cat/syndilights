* More cleanup: the only required is the nb of leds/strip, not H/W
* Process as fast as possible (no frame sync required)
* Get the OctoWS2811 out, try to go upstream
* There will be 2 Serial ports used, the startChar will not be used anymore (Serial1 will *only* get LED data)
* remove commented/debug code
