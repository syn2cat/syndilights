syndilights v2
==============

This is a Python3 implementation for the syndilights project.
Nb: The Processing Python code is Python2

This readme assumes you are in the 'v2' directory.

Installation
============

```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Base Setup
==========

Make sure redis-server is running. If it is you should be able to connect to port 6379

```
$ telnet localhost 6379
Trying 127.0.0.1...
Connected to localhost.
Escape character is '^]'
```

If not this might happen and you have to launch redis-server:

```
$ telnet localhost 6379
Trying 127.0.0.1...

telnet: connect to address 127.0.0.1: Connection refused
telnet: Unable to connect to remote host
$ redis-server

[74407] 22 Mar 11:47:33.715 * The server is now ready to accept connections on port 6379
```

Run the listener receiving the images from the clients:

```
    python3 backend/forwarding/receiver.py
```

Run the forwarder that talks to the teensy via Serial and make sure to adapt the 'serialConfigure' option in the file:

```
    python3 backend/forwarding/forward.py
```


Processing
==========

To use syndilights with processing you need to push the following code onto the Teensy 3.1:

```
    backend/arduino/VideoDisplayTeensy31/VideoDisplayTeensy31.ino
```

/!\ When running the teensdyduino installer over your Arduino (tested on 1.0.6) installation make sure NO libraries are selected (yes, NOT even the WS2811) /!\

Open processing and add a new Mode. This can be achieved by clicking on 'Java' -> Add Modeâ€¦
In the mode manager select Python and install

/!\ Restart processing /!\

Next step will be to open the following file in processing:

```
    backend/processing/PixelControl_TCP/PixelControl_TCP.pyde
```

Configure the height and width of your Pixel Setup
A frame rate of 30 is good enough for most uses
For test purposes the brightness has been set to low

The current demo is a green dot that will chase around the LED-strip.

Setting long_line to True or False will change the wrapping mode

Sending images to the grid
==========================

<section needs revision>

Run the script merging the images:

```
    python3 png_merger.py
```

Run the scripts sending the images:

```
    python3 png_creator.py
```
